## Todo
- [x] OR add parts yourself as needed, but then the order matters (how does a wall know that there is a top part?)
- [x] Implement grids for features
- [x] Grid spacing
- [ ] Implement inlay textile cover thingy
- [ ] Implement lid textile sandwich thingy
- [ ] Scale canvas height automatically based on packed parts
- [ ] See if we can still move to a single object for project definition, dependencies can be resolved during render (such as slots, thicknesses, etc)
- [x] confirm that drawslots work well with dividers (they dont)
- [ ] fix rounding of drawslots, dont rely on node index
- [ ] fix positioning of drawlots when placed on a grid
